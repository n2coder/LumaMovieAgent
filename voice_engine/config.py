"""Standalone voice engine settings.

Drop into any pydantic-settings BaseSettings class by inheriting VoiceSettings,
or instantiate it directly for standalone use.

Example — merge into your app settings:

    from voice_engine.config import VoiceSettings

    class AppSettings(VoiceSettings, BaseSettings):
        my_app_field: str = "hello"
        ...
